On the one hand, it's stupid to make any statement on something like "the pagan", as you are essentially generalizing thousand upon thousands of belief systems that human beings have always believed in. This not-with-standing, I'm going to sketch a through line that can be seen with the majority of paganism as we understand it.

The main thesis of paganism is that things internal in us are perceived external to us. Paganism is a generalization: we see inside ourselves desires, aversions, beliefs, etc. which we believe are the causes of our actions outside ourselves. Despite whatever theories B.F. Skinner may have had, most think their life works as the following: I do not merely eat pizza, I desire pizza and eat it because of that.

Man then sees the world act on him in similar ways that he acts on the world. Animals bite, wind blows on him, and apples fall off of trees. Rather than mechanically explaining the apple falling as a reaction to its connection to the tree becoming weaker than the force of gravity, can we not explain this by saying, in fact, the apple itself chose to come closer to the Earth? What if in the way that I move my hand to my face I am looking at the apple go through space the same way?

There is solace in this understanding, almost like how one feels when in a long term relationship and you know your beloved is somewhere in the home, doing their own thing. You don't see them immediately, but you are still in their presence, interaction can be had. Moreover, we often imagine these extra minds as beneficial or benevolent towards us, perhaps a marker of our narcissism, or maybe our inborn optimism. The tree giving me shade is always a kind tree, and if I, say, put a tender hand on it to give thanks, I only imagine it receiving it in kind.

Indeed, there is something exciting about these added minds. In a way, it promises a deep connection. A human being is the potential for a great relationship, and an animistic world gives us the same. The barrier between us and the world is finite, we need only find the hidden door--we could potentially talk with the mind in the tree if only we focused hard enough.

Pets are manifestations of this desire for extra minds--after all, what are pets if not the receivers of our mind exportation. We cry when they die because they weren't just alive, we were in dialogue with them. The relationship between us and our pets is decidedly an I-Thou relationship, and a world in which everything has Thou-ness is a consoling one.

It is interesting then that the G-d of Abraham despised paganism profusely. The movements of nature were not to be anthropomorphized. Instead, it was man that was diety-morphized: 

> Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.

Genesis 1:26-28


The result is decidedly a lack of integration with the world itself as Man is directly above the world and we have G-d to thank for that place on the pedestal. Under such a belief system, human relations take priority over natural concerns as, when you are with others, you are experiencing G-d in a very real way, however limited.

Importantly too is that paganism is imaginative. It is not the world of answers, it is the world of magic. All that is understood is that there are other beings out their like you, their power and their exact nature is an endless mystery. Perhaps the demarcation between a mysterious paganism and an organized religion is this issue of what the deities are actually like.

In the "interwoveness" of which paganism allows, it does not allow for the "personalism" and care that a monotheism readily gives. In paganism, you are in constant dialogue; in monotheism, you are in constant care and consideration.
